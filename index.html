                    <p>Project made by writing server-side code in Python to store a list of favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This data is served as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers.</p>

                    <h4>Tournament Results</h4>
                    <p>This project consists of a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament, and a database schema to store the game matches between players.</p>

                    <h4>Item Catalog</h4>
                    <p>This is an application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provides a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items. This RESTful web application uses the Python framework Flask along with third-party OAuth authentication.</p>

                    <h4>Doctor-Patient Web Services</h4>
                    <p>This is a restful web services project using Java which provides CRUD operations involving doctor/patients information. The general idea is that we have an information management system where we can use web services to create, read, update and delete various information items .</p>

                    <h4>Many Random Numbers</h4>
                    <p>This is the final project in my Graduate Research Seminar course. We were assigned to explore the behavior of a Pascal random number generator throwing large number of random numbers and collecting them equally into histogram bins. This was to demonstrate the phenomena known as ‘Law of large numbers’. We then had to present this empirically generated data in forms of graphs and explanations. Using this voice-over PPT, I presented the data generated in this project.</p>
